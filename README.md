# Horiseon Refactor HW #1

## Overview

This is the first homework assignment for the 2021 SMU Coding Bootcamp. 
Here is a link to the deployed site: https://zd092718.github.io/zdowdhoriseonrefactorhw1/.
It contains a refactored webpage which contains proper semantic HTML code and CSS. 
All of the div elements were removed from the HTML and replaced with the correct semantic HTML.
I reformatted the CSS file to condense the code and removed about fifty lines of cluttered code by merging content under the correct corresponding class tags.
As you can see in the final product below, the HTML code was refactored to be more 
compliant with HTML5 standards while still maintaining the original pages content.
