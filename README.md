# Horiseon Refactor HW #1

## Overview

This is the first homework assignment for the 2021 SMU Coding Bootcamp. 
Here is a link to the deployed site: https://zd092718.github.io/zdowdhoriseonrefactorhw1/.
It contains a refactored webpage which contains proper semantic HTML code and CSS. 
All of the div elements were removed from the HTML and replaced with the correct semantic HTML.
I reformatted the CSS file to condense the code and removed about fifty lines of cluttered code by merging content under the correct corresponding class tags.

## Final Product Appearance
